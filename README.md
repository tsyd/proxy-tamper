# proxy-tamper

A HTTP proxy library for node.js that allows for selective requests to be tampered.

## Installation

Either install via `npm`:

    npm install proxy-tamper

Or via a `git clone`:

    cd node_modules
    git clone git://github.com/tsyd/proxy-tamper.git
    npm link

## Example

The following example demonstrates `proxy-tamper` abilities:

    var proxy = require('proxy-tamper').start({port: 8080});

    // block all URLs that contain 'block' in them
    proxy.tamper(/block/, 'This content is blocked!');
   
    // disallow Google 
    proxy.tamper(/google/, function (request) {
      request.url = request.url.replace(/google/g, 'bing'); 
    });

    // replace all instances of 'Apple' with 'Orange' in TechCrunch articles
    proxy.tamper(/techcrunch.com.*\/$/, function (request) {
      // gzip encoding is not supported when tampering the body
      delete request.headers['accept-encoding'];

      request.onResponse(function (response) {
        // tamper the body
        response.body = response.body.replace(/Apple/g, 'Orange');
        response.headers['server'] = 'proxy-tamper 1337';

        // complete the response
        response.complete();
      }); 
    });

To tamper HTTP requests with a string or result of a function call, specify a regular expression for the URL and a string or function:

    proxy.tamper(/block/, 'This content is blocked!');

The response body of all URLs that contain `block` in them will be `This content is blocked!'.

It is possible to manipulate the original request before it's executed over the proxy. The request object has access to `request.url`, `request.headers`, and `request.method`:

    proxy.tamper(/google/, function (request) {
      request.url = request.url.replace(/google/g, 'bing'); 
    });

It is also possible to modify the response before proxying it back to the original request by specifying an `onResponse` handler:
    
    // replace all instances of 'Apple' with 'Orange' in TechCrunch articles
    proxy.tamper(/techcrunch.com.*\/$/, function (request) {
      // gzip encoding is not supported when tampering the body
      delete request.headers['accept-encoding'];

      request.onResponse(function (response) {
        // tamper the body
        response.body = response.body.replace(/Apple/g, 'Orange');
        response.headers['server'] = 'proxy-tamper 1337';

        // complete the response
        response.complete();
      }); 
    });

The `onResponse` handler has read and write access to a subset of the `http.ClientResponse` response object, namely: `response.headers`, `response.statusCode`, and `response.url`. The `onResponse` handler may also modfiy the string representation of the response body by accessing `response.body`.

To kill the current tamper instance use `proxy.end()`

### Usage

To test the example application, simply run:

    node example.js

Then set your browser to use `127.0.0.1:8080` as the HTTP proxy, and visit the following URLs:

 * <http://google.com/block/>
 * <http://techcrunch.com/tag/apple/>
