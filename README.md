# proxy-tamper

A HTTP proxy library for node.js that allows for selective requests to be tampered.

## Installation

Either install via npm:

    npm install proxy-tamper

Or via a git clone:

    cd node_modules
    git clone git://github.com/tsyd/proxy-tamper.git
    npm link

## Examples

To mock HTTP requests with a string or result of a function call, specify a regular expression for the URL and a string or function:

    var proxy = require('./lib/proxy-tamper').start({ port: 8080 });

    proxy.tamper(/test/, 'tampered');

It is possible to manipulate the original request before it's executed over the proxy. The request object has access to `request.url`, `request.headers`, and `request.method`:

    proxy.tamper(/translate\.google\..*?\/translate_a\/t/, function (request) {
      // disallow translations
      request.url = request.url.replace(/hl=../, 'hl=en').replace(/tl=../, 'tl=en')
        .replace(/sl=../, 'sl=en').replace(/text=.*/, 'text=No+translation+for+you!');
    });

It is also possible to modify the response before proxying it back to the original request by specifying an `onResponse` handler:

    proxy.tamper(/tsyd\.net\/$/, function (request) {
      request.onResponse(function (response) {
        // called when we have the response from the tampered url
      
        response.body = reverseHeadings(response.body); // reverseHeadings defined elsewhere
        response.headers['server'] = 'proxy-tamper 1337';
      
        // the onResponse handler must complete the response
        response.complete();
      });
    });

The `onResponse` handler has read and write access to a subset of the `http.ClientResponse` response object, namely: `response.headers`, `response.statusCode`, and `response.url`. The `onResponse` handler may also modfiy the string representation of the response body by accessing `response.body`.

### Usage

To test the example application, simply run:

    node example.js

Then set your browser to use `127.0.0.1:8080` as the HTTP proxy, and visit the following URLs:

 * <http://stackoverflow.com/test>
 * <http://tsyd.net>
 * <http://translate.google.com> (Attempt to translate something.)
